# Component Quick Start

These instructions will get the Kgrid Component up and running so that it can be played with relatively quickly. Not all components will have this, especially if they are just dependencies that get included in another project. This readme should be aimed toward non-technical users.

## Prerequisites

For running the application you need:

- [Technology you need](http://link-to-technology-set-up.com)

## Running the Component

1. First Step - These should be short and concise steps that a non-technical person could follow
2. Second Step - Do some things
3. Third Step - Probably a command to start the component, notice that the code block is indented.
    ```bash
    java -jar kgrid-component-#.#.#.jar --kgrid.component.setting=True
    ```
## Verifying that it works

It's a good idea to have a few things the person can do to verify everything is working correctly. Checking a health endpoint, messing with some Knowledge Objects, executing a couple commands, etc.

## Using the component

Additional information that someone who has never seen this component might want to mess with.
